                    <p> Various packages are availabe , book them from any shops avaialble nearby calangute, baga beaches.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Water rides at Malvan, Maharashtra :</b> Many people offer you cheap water sports packages, but they involve a journey of around 3hrs
                            , they take you to Goa/ Maharashtra border and will carryout the rides there.
                            Banana ride, speed boat, para sailing, bumper ride, jet ski, scuba, up and down pickup, breakfast and lunch. You can get this packagge at around 1800 in Malvan,
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Water rides at Island,Goa :</b> If you want to do it in Goa, they take you to an island nearby 50kms by boat, and it can cost you from 2200-2800( bargain them , they will reduce price).
                            For group bookings they offer a little more discount. They say that site seeing and dophins ( that's not much worthy at all) is the If you are not much into Scuba diving( they just allow us to do it for 1-2mins),better to do the 
                            water rides in calangute/baga beach, you can get those 5 in 1 water rides package at 1500rs, I feel that's the best, because if you go to either of the previous packages,
                            one day will get wasted there. So carefully pickupp your packages.
